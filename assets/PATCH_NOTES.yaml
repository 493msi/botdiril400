    Adding onto Murray's previous change and also reflecting Stronge's feedback, I wanna expand upon the idea of giving oil as a reward.

    * New oil rewards:
    * Level 50 - 1x :oil~1:
    * Level 100 - 2x :oil~1:
    * Level 150 - 3x :oil~1:
    * Level 200 - 4x :oil~1:
    * Levels 250 to 10000 - 5x :oil~1: every 50 levels

  "300.24b_2020-03-07": |-
    Now, each time a user levels up 50 levels, they will receive a guaranteed oil as reward.

    LV 50/100/150... >> Oil as reward, including the usual gold and chests

  "300.24b_2020-03-05": |-
    Pickaxes V,X and XV are considered to be milestones, so they will become unbreakable for the sake of player progression.

    Pickaxe XV --> 10% >> 0%
